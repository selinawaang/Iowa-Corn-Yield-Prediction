# Iowa Corn Yield Prediction

## Goal:
Predict corn yield in bushels per acre for each county in the state of Iowa.

## Data Sources:
- Corn yield: USDS quick stats
- Meterological and climate data: 

## Progress tacker:

### Stage 1: Complete
- Build an end to end pipeline to:
    - retrieve data using API
    - clean and preprocess data
    - engineer features features
    - train and evaluate models: RandomForest, Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, XGBoost
    - predict on test data
- Implement Bayesian optimization to tune model parameters
- Create visualizations using Tableau and GeoPandas


### Stage 2: In Progress
- Improve model performance
- Expand dataset to include more soil data
- [Complete] Implement Emsemble model
- 

### Stage 3: In Progress
- Use sattelite data to build a deep learning network and compare performance with traditional ML approach
